This mod adds special music boxes that play Spectral Aves' Calamity mod music remixes.


Boxes are crafted by catching a Spectral Avian in a bug net and putting it in a terrarium, crafting bread (Hay and a water bottle at a furnace), then crafting Bread with the respective box at the Spectral Avian Terrarium


**CALAMITY MUST BE INSTALLED FOR THIS MOD TO WORK**
